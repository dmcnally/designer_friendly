DesignerFriendly
================

Designer friendly is aimed at making it easier for designers to style the
various inputs types used within rails forms.  By providing different
custom form builders which render out partials it is easier for a designer
to provide a number of form styles that may be used within an application.

This plugin does not have any unit tests at this point and has only been
developed against edge rails.

Usage
=====

To generate a custom form builder use the following command from the application
root

./script/generate designer_friendly <form_builder_name>

Example
=======

./script/generate designer_friendly pretty

Will generate the custom form builder PrettyFormBuilder.  The PrettyFormBuilder
class will be created in the models folder.  The partials for the form builder
will be created in the "forms/pretty_form_builder".  In the first instance only
a "general" and "general_with_errors" partial will be created.


To use the builder specify the builder when using form_for :-

form_for @object, :builder => PrettyFormBuilder do

end

More instructions will appear here when I haven't had a drink!
