DesignerFriendly
================

Designer friendly is aimed at making it easier for designers to style the
various inputs types used within rails forms.  By providing different
custom form builders which render out partials it is easier for a designer
to provide a number of form styles that may be used within an application.

As the plugin evolves over the coming days I'll get around to posting some
instructions on its usage here.
